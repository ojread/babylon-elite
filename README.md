I started this project to learn the Babylon.js game engine. I was playing with Three.js which is good for graphics but is not a complete game engine.

I will attempt to create a simple space flight sim taking a lot of inspiration from the original Elite.

Feature ideas:
* Simple 3D graphics, either wireframe or flat polys.
* Playable in the browser on any modern device.
* Mouse, keyboard and touch controls.
* Pilot your spaceship around a solar system.
* Battle AI ships.
* Dock with space stations.
* Buy and sell goods.
* Upgrade your ship and equipment.
